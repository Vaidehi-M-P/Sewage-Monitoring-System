# Sewage-Monitoring-System
This project is designed to monitor the flow rate and volume of sewage using a flow sensor, and display the data on an LCD. It also includes a **buzzer** to alert when the sewage level exceeds a certain threshold. The system uses an **interrupt-driven flow sensor** to measure the flow rate and calculate the sewage volume over time.
